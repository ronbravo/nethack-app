# Nethack Game

A game based on the nethack game built for learning web development concepts.

This project uses a `package.json5` instead of a `package.json` file. This is because the project is to be installed and managed with [pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org/) instea of npm. Because of this change pnpm supports the [json5](https://json5.org/) file format which is allows for commenting out sections of a file.

In many of the directories of the project are found `README.md` files (ex: `/public/README.md`). These help to document the structure, coding style, and concepts / ideas behind the project. This all can be used as a reference to help guide you in your own projects.
